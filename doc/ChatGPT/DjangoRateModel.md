I'm using django, and I need to pair 2 user columm. Bacause I need a model that does store date for rate a user to a user.

You can create a model that stores a relationship between two users in Django by using a ForeignKey. Here's an example:


```py
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models

class UserPair(models.Model):
    user1 = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='user1', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user2 = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='user2', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.FloatField(default=0)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

This model creates a relationship between two users using two `ForeignKey` fields, `user1` and `user2`, which link to the `User` model. The rating field is a float that stores a rating between 0 and 1, and the date field is a `DateTimeField` that stores the date and time the relationship was created.

How if i using ManyTo

Answer

You can use a ManyToManyField if you want to allow multiple relationships between the same two users. Here's an example:

```py
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models

class UserPair(models.Model):
    user1 = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='user1_pairs', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user2 = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='user2_pairs', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    ratings = models.ManyToManyField(to=Rating, through='UserPairRating')

class Rating(models.Model):
    rating = models.FloatField(default=0)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class UserPairRating(models.Model):
    user_pair = models.ForeignKey(UserPair, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.ForeignKey(Rating, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

This creates a `ManyToManyField` called ratings in the `UserPair` model, which links to the Rating model through a `UserPairRating` intermediate model. The `UserPairRating` model stores the relationship between a specific `UserPair` and Rating instance. This way, you can store multiple ratings for the same pair of users.

Question

Thank you, I have another question that related with above. If I did Rate user model, How should I design? One is `user_from` and another is `user_to` which means who(from) rates who(to). And there's Another model, Which is `Trade`. Rating is can be done each time they trade. Trade has a user who is seller. and buyers are many. Each time they did 'trade', Seller and Buyers are can 'rate' each user. (but not themself. only seller to buyers, buyer to seller) Can you design the model?

-----
Answer

You can design the models as follows:

```py
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models

class Trade(models.Model):
    seller = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='seller_trades', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    buyers = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name='buyer_trades', through='TradeParticipant')
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class TradeParticipant(models.Model):
    trade = models.ForeignKey(Trade, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

class Rating(models.Model):
    user_from = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='ratings_given', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user_to = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='ratings_received', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    trade = models.ForeignKey(Trade, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.FloatField(default=0)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

This model creates a `Trade` model that stores information about a trade between a seller and multiple buyers, who are linked through the `TradeParticipant` model. The `TradeParticipant` model is an intermediate model that associates a specific Trade instance with a `User`.

The Rating model stores a relationship between two users, represented by the `user_from` and `user_to` fields, and links it to a specific Trade instance. The `user_from` field is linked to the `User` model through the ratings_given related name, and the `user_to` field is linked through the ratings_received related name.

Note: Make sure to add proper validation to prevent a user from rating themselves and to prevent multiple ratings for the same trade between the same two users.

Question

It's great. But I think that Trade has parent which is 'TradePost'. It's define the 'who' is the seller, 'where' to sell, and 'what' to sell. And Each time they trade, `Trade` will happend. Trade model is one-to-one (seller-to-buyer). Not Many to Many.

In conclusion. `TradePost` has information of trade data. which has seller, location, goods.
`Trade` is a trade each time they trade. Should have foregin key or many to many field to `TradePost`. it's One to One, Seller to Buyer model.
`Rating` is based on the `Trade`. If trade happend. User can rate based on trade. both buyer and seller can be rate user.

You can design the models as follows:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models

class TradePost(models.Model):
    seller = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='seller_posts', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    goods = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Trade(models.Model):
    trade_post = models.OneToOneField(TradePost, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    buyer = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='buyer_trades', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class Rating(models.Model):
    user_from = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='ratings_given', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user_to = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='ratings_received', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    trade = models.OneToOneField(Trade, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.FloatField(default=0)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
This model creates a `TradePost` model that stores information about the trade post made by the seller for a specific location and goods.

The `Trade` model stores information about a specific trade between the seller and buyer, and links to a specific `TradePost` instance through a one-to-one relationship.

The `Rating` model stores a relationship between two users, represented by the `user_from` and `user_to` fields, and links it to a specific Trade instance through a one-to-one relationship. The `user_from` field is linked to the User model through the `ratings_given` related name, and the user_to field is linked through the `ratings_received` related name.

Note: Make sure to add proper validation to prevent a user from rating themselves and to prevent multiple ratings for the same trade between the same two users.

Question

Ok, that's great. But It seems like `OneToOneField` on `Rating` is invalid. Because `Trade` can have two ratings. one is from seller to buyer, another one is from buyer to seller. If i said wrong, Please correct me. otherwise, Give me the new answer.

Answer

If I understand correctly, you want to allow multiple Rating objects to be created for a single `Trade` object, one from the seller to the buyer and one from the buyer to the seller. To accomplish this, you can change the OneToOneField on the Rating model to a `ForeignKey` field. Here's the updated model:

```py
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models

class TradePost(models.Model):
    seller = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='seller_posts', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    goods = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Trade(models.Model):
    trade_post = models.OneToOneField(TradePost, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    buyer = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='buyer_trades', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class Rating(models.Model):
    user_from = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='ratings_given', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user_to = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='ratings_received', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    trade = models.ForeignKey(Trade, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.FloatField(default=0)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

This allows for multiple `Rating` objects to be created for a single Trade object, representing the ratings from the seller to the buyer and from the buyer to the seller.

Question

Oh, Just another question. User is can be deleted. So `Rating` should not be deleted if `user_from` is deleted. Also `TradePost` as it remains untill all buyers account is deleted. If `user_from` on Rating and `seller` on `TradePost` account are deleted. They will shown as 'deleted user'.

-----
Answer
-----

You can achieve this by using the `SET_NULL` option in the `ForeignKey` fields for `user_from` in the `Rating` model and seller in the `TradePost` model. This will allow the related `Rating` and `TradePost` objects to remain in the database even if the referenced `User` object is deleted, and set the value of the `ForeignKey` field to `NULL` in the related objects. Here's the updated code:

```py
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models

class TradePost(models.Model):
    seller = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='seller_posts', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    goods = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Trade(models.Model):
    trade_post = models.OneToOneField(TradePost, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    buyer = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='buyer_trades', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class Rating(models.Model):
    user_from = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='ratings_given', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    user_to = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='ratings_received', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    trade = models.ForeignKey(Trade, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.FloatField(default=0)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
With this setup, if a `User` object is deleted, the related Rating and TradePost objects will remain in the database, but the `seller` and `user_from` fields in the related objects will be set to `NULL`. You can handle the display of deleted users in your views or templates.

Question
-----
Also, `trade_post` should not be `OneToOneField` on `Trade` too. Trade will happens multiple time based on `TradePost`.

-----
Answer
-----

Yes, you're correct. A single `TradePost` can have multiple Trade instances. In that case, `Trade` should have a `ForeignKey` field to `TradePost` instead of a `OneToOneField`. Here's the updated code:

```py
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db import models

class TradePost(models.Model):
    seller = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='seller_posts', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    goods = models.CharField(max_length=255)

class Trade(models.Model):
    trade_post = models.ForeignKey(TradePost, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    buyer = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='buyer_trades', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

class Rating(models.Model):
    user_from = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='ratings_given', on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    user_to = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='ratings_received', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    trade = models.ForeignKey(Trade, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    rating = models.FloatField(default=0)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

-----
Question
-----

And `Trade` won't be deleted when `TradePost` is deleted. Because it does a "log" things.

-----
Answer
-----

Yes, you're correct. If you want to keep a record of all trades even if the `TradePost` is deleted, you can change the `on_delete` option for the `trade_post` field in the `Trade` model to `models.SET_NULL` instead of `models.CASCADE`:

```py
class Trade(models.Model):
    trade_post = models.ForeignKey(TradePost, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    buyer = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='buyer_trades', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```
This way, if a `TradePost `is deleted, the `trade_post` field in the related Trade instances will be set to `NULL` instead of being deleted.
